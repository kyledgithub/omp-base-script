## (open.mp/SA-MP) base script
Hello, this is a script I have created in my spare time. It is designed to help new PAWN scripters to get started quickly.
It's like a friendly guidebook that covers the basic of starting a very basic and simple script using MySQL and Bcrypt for password hashing. This script can be used as a base for your new gamemode.

I'm going to try my best to keep this script newbie-friendly and will comment things extensively to help everyone understand.
But you must have at least a basic understanding of how Pawn works.
